# PJ_Tools

Nuke tools created by me (some tools make use, or modify tools created by other people). 

Saved as groups in .nk files so you can just paste them right into a nuke session.

Listen, I'm no git pro but you should be able to just clone this repo and add this line to your init.py:
nuke.pluginAddPath('./PJ_Tools')
And it should add the menu and all the tools for you.
